Hi, my name is Pratik Mahajan. I am a Software Engineer based in United States. I am passionate about developing new things and working on challenging projects. 

I bring with me an excellent problem solving ability and quick adaptability to new technologies and work environments which helps me to hit the ground running. 

I love building new things and in the past I have worked on many challenging and cutting edge technologies. I often like to work outside my comfort zone in order to constantly innovate and learn something new. I am a big fan of automation and usually automate almost all of my repetitive manual tasks.
